## First up, it's really, really cool
People think it's fun and filled with adventure - because it is. But I want to share some sides the are less talked about.

You'll be living in places that people vacation to, moving depending on the weather and staying in places you've always dreamed to visit. I lived on the beach in Hawaii, a cabin in Lake Tahoe, a farmhouse in butt-fuck nowhere Vermont and a high rise in New York City. You wonâ€™t be bound by leases or locations. But like everything, nomadic life comes at a cost. You often sacrifice community for freedom, depth for exploration.

I've always had a strong desire to live like this, and given my chance, I'd still do it again. However, there are some things that I'd like to have known going into it. ðŸ˜¬ There are no solutions for these problems because they are just tradeoffs to live the lifestyle.

## Your hobbies will take a hit
You know how you used to go on the same running route or practiced the piano throughout the week? These things will still be possible, but much, much harder.

A routine is a cognitive shortcut, and without this shortcut every time you move you'll need to start from scratch again. Where will you run? What is your new baseline time? How are you going to get there? And that's just one example. Dammed if I know how you'd keep up with things like playing an instrument.

## You will realise you need less than you thought
I've lived out of a carry-on suitcase for the entire time. I've swapped out some things as the weather changes - a coat for the Winter, and bathers for the Summer. But for the most part, I've never felt like I've needed any more. I used to have all sorts of stuff in my room "just in case". But after leaving it all behind, I can't even recall what I left because I haven't ever needed it.

Some of the things I couldn't live without:
* Hoodie - Regardless of weather trains, offices and planes always seem to be cold
* Eye mask - You're going to be spending some time on couches and there's often no curtains in these rooms
* Noise-cancelling headphones - This will make sleeping on planes easier, and getting to sleep in foreign places more relaxing

## "Happiness is only real when shared" - Christopher McCandless
Living and exploring a place is fun by yourself... for a week. You'll soon long to speak to someone - or have a friend that you already know and just get to relax with.

Plan your visits around places that you know that you have a friend or a friend of a friend. You'll get the local touch when they suggest a bar or a hike. They'll even introduce you to their friends to build up an instant network in that city to hang with.

As nice as it is having new friends around all the time, you will miss your regular group of friends. It's hard to develop a close friend in 1 month, especially when you'll be starting from scratch the next month too. Prepare yourself for meeting 10x the amount of people, but never really getting deeper than "acquaintance" with them.

## TLDR: It is a thrill, but comes with lots of costs
It's been a great time, but it's been tiring. I'm not as close to some of my friends, I had a relationship fizzle out and I've spent a shit-tonne of money. But it's an experience that has changed me forever. I used to identify myself as someone who didn't need anyone else, who was afraid of any possessions, relationships and responsibilities that would tie me to a physical location. Now I know that I crave all those things - at least for now.
