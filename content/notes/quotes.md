# Principles that I admire

> A completely predictable future is already the past.

> Imagine the idea that the moment you were born you were kicked off the edge of a precipice, and you are falling. As you fell, a great lump of rock came with you, and it’s traveling alongside you. And you’re clinging to it for dear life! And thinking, ‘Gee, I’ve gotta hold onto this.’ You see? Well, it doesn’t do a thing for you. And it’s only making you anxious, and as soon as you understand that it doesn’t do a thing for you that you let go and relax. ... We’re all headed straight for death, as if we had been condemned by a judge. And yet here we are all clinging onto things. And we have all sorts of alibis for doing this. We say, ‘Well, I have responsibilities for my dependents, and I’ve got to cling on.’ But all you’re doing is you’re teaching your dependents to cling the same way as you are and making them miserable by learning to go on surviving compulsively.

> For unless one is able to live fully in the present, the future is a hoax. There is no point whatever in making plans for a future which you will never be able to enjoy. When your plans mature, you will still be living for some other future beyond. You will never, never be able to sit back with full contentment and say, "Now, I've arrived!" Your entire education has deprived you of this capacity because it was preparing you for the future, instead of showing you how to be alive now.
