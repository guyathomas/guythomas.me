The frontend interview commonly has different skills to be tested for. The types of interviews are as follows

## Coding Interviews

### [Build a UI Component](./the-frontend-interview/build-a-component)

Your task is to build a component. These interviews are typically framework agnostic. You will be evaluated based on your ability to clarify requirements and your ability to existing clean, re-usable code.

### [Build a JS Class](./the-frontend-interview/build-a-js-class)

Your task is to build a class or function that that performs some specific behavior. These typically replicate functionality that is familiar to you. Examples are a `Promise` class or an `EventEmitter` class.

### [Algorithm / Data Structures](./the-frontend-interview/algorithm-and-data-structures)

Typically no more difficult than leetcode medium. Brushing up on trees and things like "find the most frequent element in an array" are suggested.

## Architecture

### [Design a component](./the-frontend-interview/design-a-component)

Designing the API and how the implementation would work for a specific UI component - for example a `react-select` clone or a `tooltip` component.

### [Design an application flow](./the-frontend-interview/design-an-application-flow)

Given a high level spec for a feature you are expected to

- Clarify requirements for the feature

- Design how navigation flow should work

- Design desired API requests / payloads
