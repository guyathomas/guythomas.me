## Becoming a type 2 investor

There are two types of investors

1. Those that find deals and invest in them ( i.e. like buying a computer )
2. Those that assemble the parts of a deal and bring them together ( i.e. buying the parts for a computer and selling it )

Steps to become a type 2 invesstor.

1. Find an opportunity that everyone else missed.
2. Raise money. The bank is one way, but to get ahead you need to learn new methods to raise capital. Acting as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller is one way - just bridging the deel.
3. Organize smart people.

## Obstacles

> That’s the most common form of laziness: laziness by staying busy.

> Simply put, people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for financial pressure can never be rich.

> When you come up short, let the pressure build and don’t dip into your savings or investments.

## Investing in yourself

> It is what you know that is your greatest wealth. It is what you do not know that is your greatest risk.

> You want to know a little about a lot

> Most people simply buy investments rather than first investing in learning about investing.

### Management Skills

> Focus on developing management skills. The three most important management skills necessary to start your own business are management of: 1. Cash flow 2. People 3. Personal time

> The main management skills needed for success are: 1. Management of cash flow 2. Management of systems 3. Management of people

> Many middle managers remain middle managers, failing to get promoted, because they know how to work with people below them, but not with people above them.

## Brokers

> Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice ... if, the people are professionals, their services should make you money. And the more money they make, the more money I make.

> A good broker should provide you with information, as well as take the time to educate you.

> Be cautionary though, most brokers are only salespeople.

> When I interview any paid professional, I first find out how much property or stocks they personally own and what percentage they pay in taxes.

> Find a broker who has your best interests at heart. Many brokers will spend the time educating you, and they could be the best asset you find.

## Investment Trends

> on an average 10 investments, I hit home runs on two or three, while five or six do nothing, and I lose on two or three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in at that time.

> On every one of my investments, there must be an upside, something for free—like a condominium, a mini-storage, a piece of free land, a house, stock shares, or an office building. And there must be limited risk, or a low-risk idea.
