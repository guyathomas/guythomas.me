> Bring something to the table. If you lack money, there are other things you can bring to the table in a transaction—if structured correctly—including education, time, connections, confidence, intelligence, and creativity. By reading this book, you are already taking steps toward building your strengths in those areas. Many investors use little or none of their own money when investing in real estate by applying one of several methods that include: Partners Lease option strategies FHA 3.5 percent down payment loans USDA or VA no-down payment loans Home equity loans or lines of credit Seller financing Private/hard money Wholesaling

> One of his favorite methods, which he began using early on, is simply knocking on doors of people who are significantly late on their mortgage payments and in danger of losing their homes. If no one is home, he tapes a simple message to the door. According to Anson, “It’s easy to ignore a generic mailer, but hard to ignore a person standing at your door. Since most other wholesalers and flippers are not out there knocking on doors, you tend to stand out.”

> different markets allow for different types of investments to prosper. Denver (or any expensive city) might not be conducive to cash-flowing rental properties, but many house flippers, pop toppers (adding a second story to a single-story home to increase value), and developers are raking in the cash right now.

> If your market is incredibly expensive, you have four real options: Don’t invest, but simply wait on the sidelines for the market to change. I don’t recommend this one, but it’s a possibility. Look harder. Oftentimes, the market might be overheated, but good deals can be found for those willing to look harder for those deals. Luckily, we’ll look at 27 unique strategies for finding real estate deals in Chapter Six. Change your strategy to something that your expensive market does allow (like flipping or development). Invest someplace else. This might mean driving 60 minutes outside the expensive city to find deals in smaller, more rural markets, or it might mean building a team at a distance and investing 2,000 miles away.

> I (Josh) first began investing in real estate, I lived in Los Angeles but bought properties in the Mid-west. I immediately found myself in a world of hurt and never really made money on those investments because I didn’t realize how difficult long-distance investing could be when you are not prepared. Therefore, if long-distance investing is in your future, I would recommend picking up a copy of Long-Distance Real Estate Investing by David Greene, published by BiggerPockets Publishing.

> But LLCs and corporations have one major downside, especially for new investors: difficulty in obtaining loans. When you first begin buying real estate, you’ll probably buy smaller residential properties with conventional loans. Let’s say, you’ll get a bank loan and probably buy a single-family house. But most banks do not lend money on a residential property to a legal entity—they only want to lend to a real person.

> 9. Do I Need to Have a Real Estate License? Definitely not, but it could come in handy. A real estate license is not necessary for investing in real estate. A license gives you the ability to help others buy and sell real estate, but anyone can buy or sell real estate on their own without being an agent.

> Having a real estate license can come in handy for an investor, for a few reasons: Speed: In a competitive real estate market, the early bird often gets the worm. As a real estate agent, you can get first knowledge of real estate deals that are listed. Access: A licensed real estate agent can get into almost any property that is listed for sale with a special key and lockbox. In other words, you don’t have to wait for someone else to go with you or give you permission to see a property. If the home is vacant, you can head over any time, assuming the home has the special lock-box present. If the home is not vacant, you can set up a time to view it without having to fit into another agent’s schedule. Commissions: When a home is sold, the seller usually pays around 6 percent to the agents who made it happen. This fee is typically split 50-50 between the agent who listed the home and the agent who brought the buyer. Therefore, as a real estate agent, when you buy a property, you can represent yourself and use that commission toward your down payment or repairs, or to take a trip to Jamaica.

> Time: First, becoming an agent is not as easy as just signing a document. You have to take an extensive class (depending on the state, the class could be up to 190 hours long) and you must pass a difficult test, which may require long hours of studying. This takes away time from actually investing in real estate.

> Money: Then, once you become an agent, you’ll find yourself paying several thousand dollars in fees each year just to hold on to your license. Paperwork: Finally, as an agent, you’ll find yourself responsible for additional paperwork and disclosures in every deal. If you are representing yourself, you can’t simply let your agent do all the heavy lifting, because you are the agent!
