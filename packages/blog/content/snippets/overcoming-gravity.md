> In general, if you are going to cross-train strength and endurance, but have a fcus on one portien over another, an 80j20 split tends to work very well. This means that 80% of your training should be dedicated toward the particular area that you want to develop che mosc, and 20% ofyour training can be devoted to the other pares. For screngch athletes, this means there should be an 80:20 or 4:1 ratio of strength workouts to endurance workouts. For endurance athletes, this means.there should be a 4:1 ratio ofendurance workouts to strength workouts.

> For rehabilitation, you will primarily use OKC exercises because chey allow you to easily isolate speciﬂc weaknesses, targec speciﬂc structures that need to be strengthened, or improve certain movement patterns. The goal of therapy is to work your way back to gross motor CKC movements. For example, if you are undergoing therapy fr an ankle sprain, you will begin by perfrming rostly OKC exercises, which will help strengthen the muscles in che leg and prevent them fom atrophying

However, as you improve range of motion, strength, and other fctors you will begin perfrming more gross movement patterns-such as squats and standing drills-to strengthen che ankle so it can perfrm athletic movements again. Likewise, with something like elbow tendonitis, you would begin with isolation exercises to rehabilitate the injured
