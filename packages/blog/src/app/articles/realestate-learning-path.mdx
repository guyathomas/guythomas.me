### Finding an area to invest in

Although a lot of investors suggest investing in your backyard ( or near your backyard ) - for some people it may suit to invest out of state. This process can be followed to find a region out of state to invest in.

1. Find 2-3 places with net migration. [Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/domestic-migration-drove-state-and-local-population-change-2021)
2. Once you've found those, start looking into the main industries that drive growth there. If more than 20% of the local economy is centered around 1 company or 1 industry you may want to consider other alternatives.
3. Do not pick a market because it’s cheap. Usually it’s cheap for a reason. The grass is greenest over the septic tank (best returns are in the mid range)
4. Start evalutating a lot of deals. Approach it with the mentality that you are aiming to learn - if you make an offer that's a bonus. There will be hundreds that you evaluate for every offer that you make. In the beginning while you are learning it's okay to spend an hour per deal - but eventually you'll want to get this down to 10-20 mins for the initial screen.
5. Buy a plane ticket and go to your market to get a feeling for it
6. Consider how are you going to manage them. How are you going to get a loan for them. Look for professionals who themselves invest in real estate. Ask the broker for 2 lenders. Ask the lenders for 2 property managers. Do this with the key contacts in the deal and then narrow your lender and property manager down to 2-3. After you've done this - take them out to dinner and then pick one.
7. a) Tip: Starting smalll and self managing is a great way to learn collecting rent, handling maintenance, setting preventative maintenance, etc...
8. If you decide not to go ahead with an offer - never ghost the broker. Always be transparent about why you rejected it. They may be able to propose alternatives that match your criteria.
